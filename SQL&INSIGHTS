# 📊 SQL-Only Health Impact Analysis Using Pollution and Clinical Data

This project analyzes the relationship between air pollution (PM2.5 and NO₂) and hospital admissions, mortality, and diagnostic patterns using **pure SQL** — no Python, no BI tools. It's based on real-world data collected from a tertiary care hospital in India.

## 🏥 About the Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – HDHI Health Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Timeframe:** April 1, 2017 – March 31, 2019
- **Institution:** Hero DMC Heart Institute, Ludhiana, Punjab, India
- **Admissions:** 14,845 admissions (12,238 unique patients; 1,921 with repeat visits)
- **Pollution Indicators:** Daily average PM2.5 and NO₂ levels

---

## 🧪 Project Objectives

- Understand how spikes in PM2.5 and NO₂ correlate with:
  - 📈 Hospital admissions
  - ⚰️ Daily mortality counts
  - 💉 Specific diagnoses (e.g., STEMI, AKI, Heart Failure)
- Identify the most vulnerable populations by:
  - 👴 Age
  - 👨 Gender

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL Workbench)
- Raw `.csv` files joined across 3 datasets
- Aggregation, filtering, JOINs, grouping, and condition-based breakdown

## 📌 Key SQL Insights

### ✅ Step 1: Pollution vs Admissions
- PM2.5 > 350 µg/m³ didn’t always spike admissions
- However, combined PM2.5 + NO₂ levels > 150 consistently showed admission surges
  - Example: Nov 13, 2017 → PM2.5 = 379, NO₂ = 151 → 30 admissions

### ✅ Step 2: Pollution vs Mortality
- High PM2.5 + NO₂ strongly linked to increased daily deaths
  - Dec 3, 2017 → PM2.5 = 298, NO₂ = 214 → 3 deaths
- PM2.5 alone sometimes correlated with deaths, even when NO₂ was low

### ✅ Step 3: Who Is Most Affected?
- **Top Diagnoses on polluted days**:
  - ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome): 1,121
  - Heart Failure: 923
  - AKI (Acute Kidney Injury): 821
- **Mortality Trends**:
  - Ages 60–75 most affected
  - 65% of deaths were male patients
